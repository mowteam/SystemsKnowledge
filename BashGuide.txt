represent variables as [var]

Tricks/Commands:
$(command) to substitute command output
'command' to substitute command output
exec [fd]<> [file] to create file descriptor
(command) runs the command in a subhsell, similar to forking the shell
Note: tmux is very useful for creating multiple "windows" in a terminal. Look up commands online, but use ctrl-b to initiate commands

Redirection:
-reference https://www.gnu.org/software/bash/manual/html_node/Redirections.html#Redirecting-Input
- &>[file], redirects both stdout and stderr to a file
- [n]>&[fd] makes [n] a duplicate of the output file descriptor
-[n]<&digit makes [n] a duplicate of the input file descriptor
-[n]<&digit- moves the digit input file descriptor to [n], closing digit afterwards (move redirection)
-[n]>&digit- moves the digit output file descriptor to [n], closing digit afterwards (move redirection)
-Note: for either move redirection, if no digit is specified, [n] is closed

GDB:
-reference https://www.youtube.com/watch?list=PL-ymxv0nOtqqQzEncNuE6jetlJAiBUda-&v=r185fCzdw8Y (pwn.college)
-useful commands: print, examine (x), display
-gdb scripts can execute commands at breakpoints or catch points using (silent eliminates the breakpoint print out):
	b *main
	commands
		silent
		p $rip
	end
