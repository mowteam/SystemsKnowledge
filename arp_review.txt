ARP protocol

Notation:
-Target IP/MAC is the IP/MAC we are setting in the ARP table
-Sender IP/MAC is the IP/MAC of the machine that is sending the packet (or sent the packet in the case of a response)

Notes: 
-In gratuitous ARP, the Destination MAC is ignored. What differentiates gratuitous ARP is the Ethernet destination being broadcast since it is a response
-gratuitous ARP
-ARP Announcement differs from request ARP because the destination and source IP are the same in ARP Announcements
-To poison an ARP cache, send a unicast ARP Request to the machine you want to poison and change the source IP and MAC. The machine will set these in the ARP cache.

Type: Typical ARP Request
Ethernet Dest MAC: Broadcast
Operation: Request
Source MAC: Sender MAC
Source IP: Sender IP
Destination MAC: Unknown/all zeros
Destination IP: Target IP

Type: Typical ARP Response
Ethernet Dest MAC: Sender MAC
Operation: Response
Source MAC: Target MAC
Source IP: Target IP
Destination MAC: Sender MAC
Destination IP: Sender IP




Type: Gratuitous ARP, ARP Response with no Request
Use: Announce or update its IP to MAC mappings (in this case, the target IP is the one sending the packet)
Ethernet Dest MAC: Broadcast
Operation: Response
Source MAC: Target/Sender MAC
Source IP: Target/Sender IP
Destination MAC: Broadcast (ignored)
Destination IP: Target/Sender IP




Type: ARP Probe
Use: Check that an IP address is not already in use
Ethernet Dest MAC: Broadcast
Operation: Request
Source MAC: Sender MAC
Source IP: 0.0.0.0
Destination MAC: all zeros
Destination IP: Target/Probed IP




Type: ARP Announcement
Use: Claim an IP address (The sender IP and MAC are the same as the target ones that get set in ARP tables)
Ethernet Dest MAC: Broadcast
Operation: Request
Source MAC: Target/Sender MAC
Source IP: Target/Sender/Claimed IP
Destination MAC: all zeros (ignored)
Destination IP: Target/Sender/Claimed IP
