Approach:
-look for files hidden using zip archives or steg techniques
-initially use exiftool, steghide/stegseek, binwalk
-look for mangled versions of zip archive magic numbers

Tools:
-binwalk (search binary files for hidden files, byte patterns, etc.)
-steghide (hide and extract files using steg techniques)
-stegseek (steghide but brute forces passwords with wordlist)
-fzipcrack (brute force zip passwords using wordlist)
-john (john the ripper, in the context of steg, use john to generate wordlists)
-foremost (extracts files by looking for magic numbers, headers, and footers, similar to binwalk) 
-exiftool (gives information about a files header, sometimes says if there is a hidden file)
-zsteg (detect steg in PNG and BMP formats)

Zip Format:
-A zip archive must have the following:
-List of local file headers
	-start with magic number: 0x04034b50
	-information about compression and data length
-Central directory file header
	-starts with magic number: 0x02014b50
	-contains list of all the local file headers and their offsets
-End of central directory record (EOCD)
	-starts with magic number: 0x06054b50
	-end of zip archive
